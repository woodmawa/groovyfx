= Getting Started

== What's New in Version 25
GroovyFX has been significantly modernized for JavaFX 25 and Groovy 5.

=== Key Enhancements:

* **JavaFX 25 Support**: Full compatibility with the latest JavaFX features.
* **Modern Component Pack**: New high-level components including `Card`, `Badge`, `ToggleSwitch`, `Icon`, and `ResponsivePane`.
* **Reactive State Management**: New `Store` API for predictable state updates, inspired by Vuex/Pinia.
* **Advanced Table DSL**: `autoColumns` support in `TableView` for rapid prototyping.
* **JavaFX 25 Subscription API**: Integrated for cleaner, memory-safe listener management.
* **Modern Events**: DSL support for Zoom, Rotate, Swipe, and Scroll events.
* **Form Layout & Validation**: New `formLayout` for automated label alignment and declarative validation.

== Installation Requirements
Before installing GroovyFX you will need to install the Java Development Kit
(JDK) version 23 or above (required for JavaFX 25).

http://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp[Download the appropriate JDK] for your
operating system, run the installer, and then set up an environment
variable named JAVA_HOME pointing to the location of this installation.

== Using the GroovyFX Library
There are several ways in which you can include GroovyFx in your projects.

=== Maven Central

Having GroovyFX in Maven Central (thanks to Sonatype's OSS hosting!) makes it
simple to use GroovyFX in everything from simple test scripts to larger
projects.  The Maven coordinates are as follows

* _groupId_: org.groovyfx
* _artifactId_: groovyfx
* _version_: {groovyfx-version}

GroovyFX is simple to include in Groovy scripts thanks to Groovy's Grab
annotation, a part of the Grape system.  Just include the following line at the
top of your script

[source,groovy]
[subs="attributes"]
----
Testing.groovy
@Grab('org.groovyfx:groovyfx:{groovyfx-version}')
----

=== Creating a GroovyFX-Based Project with Gradle

It is also simple to set up your own GroovyFX-based project using Gradle as the
build system.  This sample build.gradle script will get you started.

[source,groovy]
[subs="attributes"]
----
plugins {
    id 'groovy'
    id 'org.openjfx.javafxplugin' version '0.1.0'
}

repositories { mavenCentral() }

dependencies {
    implementation 'org.apache.groovy:groovy:{groovy-version}'
    implementation 'org.groovyfx:groovyfx:{groovyfx-version}'
}

javafx {
    version = "{javafx-version}"
    modules = [ 'javafx.controls', 'javafx.fxml', 'javafx.web', 'javafx.media' ]
}
----

Just create a new directory for your project and place the gradle script into
it.  Then simply call

[source,groovy]
gradle makeDirs

to set up the rest of your project's directory structure.  You will
automatically have a dependency on both Groovy and GroovyFX.

== Building from Source

The project's source code is located on
https://github.com/groovyfx-project/groovyfx[GitHub].  You can clone the
GroovyFX repository using the following http://git-scm.com/[Git] command

[source]
git clone https://github.com/groovyfx-project/groovyfx.git

=== Installation Requirements

Once you have downloaded and installed a Java 23+ SDK.

=== Building with Gradle
GroovyFX uses http://www.gradle.org[Gradle] as its primary build system.
Building the project with Gradle requires only the following simple steps

[source]
cd groovyfx
gradlew build

The Gradle build script is also capable of running any of the project's demo.
To run any specific demo, e.g.the AccordionDemo, you can just use

[source]
gradlew AccordionDemo

To see an executable overview of all build tasks including all demos

[source]
gradlew --gui

=== Building with Intellij IDEA

GroovyFX's build script is capable of generating all of the project files
neccessary to build the project with Intellij IDEA.  Just run the following
command from the project's root directory

[source]
gradlew idea

This will generate a groovyfx.ipr file.  From IDEA, select File -> Open Project
and navigate to the directory containing the groovyfx.ipr file and open it.  You
should now be able to build the library and run the demos with IDEA.

=== Building with NetBeans

The NetBeans project files are included in the code repository.  You may have to
set up a Java Platform that includes the JavaFX SDK directory, if one does not
already exist.

Once you have created the JavaFX enabled Java platform, then choose the GroovyFX project,
right click and pick "Properties". Choose the "Libraries" entry, then choose the
JavaFX enabled Java Platform. You should now be able to build the library and run the demos with NetBeans.
Also, you may have to fix the location for the groovy-all jar file.

== Hello GroovyFX: Your First GroovyFX Program
Once you have everything set up, try the following Groovy script to test that your setup is functioning as it should.

[source,groovy]
[subs="attributes"]
----
@Grab('org.groovyfx:groovyfx:{groovyfx-version}')

import static groovyx.javafx.GroovyFX.start

start {
    stage(title: 'GroovyFX Hello World', visible: true) {
        scene(fill: BLACK, width: 500, height: 250) {
            hbox(padding: 60) {
                text(text: 'Groovy', font: '80pt sanserif') {
                    fill linearGradient(endX: 0, stops: [PALEGREEN, SEAGREEN])
                }
                text(text: 'FX', font: '80pt sanserif') {
                    fill linearGradient(endX: 0, stops: [CYAN, DODGERBLUE])
                    effect dropShadow(color: DODGERBLUE, radius: 25, spread: 0.25)
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
----

If everything runs correctly you should see the following screen appear.
