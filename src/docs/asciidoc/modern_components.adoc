== Modern Components

GroovyFX now includes a set of modern UI components in the `groovyx.javafx.components` package. These components are designed to provide a more contemporary look and feel and to simplify common UI patterns.

=== Card
The `card` component is a styled container with optional header, body, and footer sections. It provides a clean, elevated look typical of modern dashboards and web applications.

[source,groovy]
----
card {
    cardHeader {
        label("Card Header")
    }
    cardBody {
        label("This is the main content of the card.")
        button("Action")
    }
    cardFooter {
        label("Card Footer Information")
    }
}
----

=== Badge
The `badge` component is used for status indicators, counts, or small labels.

[source,groovy]
----
badge(text: "New", backgroundFill: Color.RED)
----

=== Icon
The `icon` component provides a simple way to add vector icons to your application. It includes a small built-in library of common icons (`save`, `edit`, `delete`, `add`, `info`, `warning`, `check`) and also supports custom SVG paths.

[source,groovy]
----
icon(iconName: "save", fill: Color.BLUE)
icon(content: "M10 10 H 90 V 90 H 10 L 10 10", fill: Color.RED) // Custom SVG path
----

=== Modern JavaFX Components
GroovyFX now provides native support for several standard JavaFX components that were introduced in later versions of JavaFX:

* `colorPicker`: A standard color selection component.
* `pagination`: A control for navigating through multi-page content.

[source,groovy]
----
colorPicker(onAction: { println "Color selected: ${it.source.value}" })
pagination(pageCount: 10, pageFactory: { index -> label("Page ${index + 1}") })
----

== External Components and SPI
GroovyFX can be extended with custom components through its SPI. External libraries can register new builder nodes that work seamlessly with the base library.

See the link:component_authoring_guide.adoc[Component Authoring Guide] for details on how to create and use external components.

== Example Applications

To see these components in action, you can explore and run the example applications provided in the source tree under `src/main/groovy/examples`.

=== Modern Dashboard
Demonstrates `card`, `badge`, `icon`, `tableView` (with `autoColumns`), and the reactive `Store`.

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew ModernDashboard
----

=== Responsive Form
Demonstrates `formLayout`, `toggleSwitch`, `responsivePane`, and the `notify()` system.

[source,bash]
